          <p class="news-subline">Pharrell Williams, Sir Lewis Hamilton and Alicia Keys were among the famous faces attending a high-end Moncler fashion event in London</p>
          <p class="news-text">Other famous faces at the Moncler show included British musicians Charlie XCX and Aitch along with 2023 Brit rising star award winners the girl group Flo. Tennis stars Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova and England footballer Marcus Rashford were also in attendance. Sir Lewis and Rashford both opted for puffer jackets, black and white, respectively, which were similar in style to Moncler’s Fall 2023 Ready-To-War collection, as they took to the red carpet. The show also featured installations by Keys, Williams and Rock Nation and Jay-Z as part of the multi-sensory event.</p>

          <img class="news-image" src="images/news2.png">
          <p class="news-subline">Alicia Keys reflects on 20 years of stardom, going makeup free and where she gets her ‘grit energy</p>
          <p class="news-text">In 2016, when Alicia Keys released her sixth studio album, Here, she celebrated the launch with a gig in New York’s Times Square. An article written in the Guardian by a journalist who was on the promotional junket described the machinery of her management system at the time, as functioning “like an onion”. A formidable, multi-layer of managers, confidants, coaches, assistants, a personal film crew and various people with ambiguous job functions formed around Keys, like a “shock absorber”. Fast forward to 2021. I am waiting to interview Keys via Zoom on the day she launches a special edition of Songs in A Minor, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the groundbreaking award-winning debut album that started it all. When she appears on screen there is no “onion”, no entourage, no shock absorber. Just her. She is sitting on a light-coloured sofa in front of a floor-to-ceiling wall of immaculately lined-up books. And she is trying to pull a jumper on. Her voice – smooth, deep and slightly gravelly – calls out, “Good morning!” and as she inches in to take her position close to the screen, she smiles so fully that every crevice of her face lights up.</p>

          <h2 class="news-title">Attention, Royal Followers: You Can Enter to Win Free Tickets to the King’s Coronation Concert</h2>
          <img class="news-image" src="images/news3.png">
          <p class="news-subline">The event includes performances from Elton John, Alicia Keys and Diana Ross, and more!</p>
          <p class="news-text">Per the BBC, “The Coronation Concert will take place on the evening of Sunday May 7th 2023 in the grounds of Windsor Castle.” The media outlet also teases that the show will “bring together music icons and contemporary stars together in celebration of this historic occasion.” Additionally, the outlet reports that the event “will also feature a selection of spoken word sequences delivered by stars of stage and screen.”</p>
          <p>Don't fret about how soon you apply for the free tickets. According to the press release, the winners will *not* be chosen on a first-come, first-serve basis, so your odds will be the same whether you apply now or on Feb. 28, at which point the ballot will close. The only stipulation is that you must be a resident of the U.K.</p>
